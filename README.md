# Movie-Recommender-system
Project on Movie Recommendation system
in this code i have used the concept of colaborative filtering .This method recommends movies to one user based on the other user's preferences like most watched or most liked/rated movies.
the datasets used in this are 'links.csv' 'ratings.csv' and 'movies.csv' 
there is another dataset called 'tags.csv' but its not used in this
